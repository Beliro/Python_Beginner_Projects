# 👋 Hi, I am Louis Belfort!

I am a budding developer, aspiring to dive into AI and Machine Learning.
My goal now is to focus on building foundational skills in Python, MySQL and Machine Learning tools.

### 💻 About This Journey

I recently started my journey into development and am using GitHub as my primary workspace to track my progress, learn Git and version control, and build a portfolio of practical projects.

My primary focus right now is strengthening my understanding of:
* 🐍 Python Fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming)
* 🛠️ Essential Tools (e.g., virtual environments, basic command line and others)
